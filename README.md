## Installation
Initial learning rates are uniformly set at 0.0001, with batch sizes standardized to 2 across all models.  Experimental evaluations are conducted within a consistent hardware and software environment, featuring a workstation equipped with dual NVIDIA RTX 4080 Super GPUs, an AMD Ryzen R9-5950X processor, and 128GB RAM.  The experimental framework is structured in Python 3.9, employing PyTorch 2.0.0 and CUDA 11.8 for computational acceleration.
